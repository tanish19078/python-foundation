# 🐍 Python Foundations

Hi there! 👋 I'm Tanish, and this is my personal learning journal as I explore the world of Python programming — all before starting college.

I created this repository to track what I’m learning each day, share simple code examples, and stay consistent. Whether you’re a beginner like me or just curious how someone else is starting out — feel free to follow along or use this as inspiration for your own journey.
