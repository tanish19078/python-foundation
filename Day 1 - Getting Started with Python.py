# Day 1 - Getting Started with Python

# 🧠 Learning Goals:
# - Run your first Python script
# - Use print statements
# - Add comments

# 👋 Hello World
print("Hello, world!")

# 🗒️ Comments help explain your code
# This is a single-line comment

"""
This is a 
multi-line comment
"""

# 🔤 Print multiple things
print("Welcome to Python!")
print("This is my first day learning to code.")
print("Let's do some math:", 5 + 3)

# ➕ Print with variables
name = "Tanish"
age = 17

print("My name is", name)
print("I am", age, "years old.")

# 🔄 Summary:
# - print() displays output
# - Use `#` for comments
# - You can print text, variables, and even math
